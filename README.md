## With @ngui/react, we can do the following from Angular2;
    
   * Pass read-only props to React component
   * Call a function in React component
   * Fire event in React componet
   * Set state of React componet
   
   You need more?  Please log a [feature requirement](https://github.com/ng2-ui/react/issues)
   
## How Does It Work

  1. Angular renders `ngui-react` component with the following attributes;

    * `reactComponent`, A React component to render. Let's call it as MyComp.
    * `reactProps`, react props for the React component, MyComp.
    * `reactState`, the initial state to be used by MyComp

  2. `ngui-react` create and render React component using; 

    * `React.createElement()`
    * `React.render()`

## Access ReactJS properties
  You can access react element and instance from Angular component.

  * reactElement:  the react element from React.createElement()
  * reactInstance: the react instance from React.render()


## Install

1. install @ngui/react

        $ npm install @ngui/react --save

2. import NguiReactModule to your AppModule

        import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
        import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
        import { BrowserModule  } from '@angular/platform-browser';
        import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
        import { NguiReactModule } from '@ngui/react';
        
        @NgModule({
          imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule, NguiReactModule],
          declarations: [AppComponent],
          bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
        })
        export class AppModule { }


For full example, please check out `app` directory to see the example of;

  - `app.module.ts`
  -  and `app.component.ts`.

## Example Usage

#### hello.ts
```
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
```
#### my-app.ts
```
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { Hello } from "./hello";  // This is a react component

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ngui-react 
      [reactComponent]="Hello"
      [reactProps]="{name:'angular2 react wrapper'}">
    </ngui-react>
  `;
  ...
```
